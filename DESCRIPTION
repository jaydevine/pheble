Title: Classifying High-Dimensional Phenotypes with Ensemble Learning
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(person("Jay", "Devine", role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),
    email = "jay.devine1@ucalgary.ca"),
    person("Bened\'ikt", "Hallgrimsson", role = c("aut"),
    email = "bhallgri@ucalgary.ca"))
Description: A system for binary and multi-class classification of 
    high-dimensional phenotypic data using ensemble learning. By combining
    predictions from different caret classification models, this package
    attempts to improve performance over individual learners. The
    pre-processing, training, validation, and testing are performed end-to-end
    to minimize user input and simplify the process of classification.
