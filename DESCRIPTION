Description: A system for binary and multi-class classification of high-dimensional phenotypic data
             using ensemble learning. By combining predictions from different classification models,
             this package attempts to improve performance over traditional models. The preprocessing, 
             training, validation, and testing are performed end-to-end, thus minimizing user input and 
             simplifying the process of classification.
