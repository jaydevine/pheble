#' Data from: Are ant supercolonies crucibles of a new major transition in evolution?
#'
#' Abstract: The biological hierarchy of genes, cells, organisms and societies is a fundamental reality in the living world.
#' This hierarchy of entities did not arise ex nihilo at the origin of life, but rather has been serially generated
#' by a succession of critical events known as ‘evolutionary transitions in individuality’ (ETIs). Given the sequential
#' nature of ETIs, it is natural to look for candidates to form the next hierarchical tier. We analyse claims that
#' these candidates are found among ‘supercolonies’, ant populations in which discrete nests cooperate as part of a
#' wider collective, in ways redolent of cells in a multicellular organism. Examining earlier empirical work and new
#' data within the recently proposed ‘Darwinian space’ framework, we offer a novel analysis of the evolutionary status
#' of supercolonies and show how certain key conditions might be satisfied in any future process transforming these
#' collaborative networks into true Darwinian individuals.

#' Data from: Sexually mediated phenotypic variation within and between sexes as a continuum structured by ecology: The mosaic nature of skeletal variation across body regions in Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.)
#'
#' Abstract: Ecological character displacement between the sexes, and sexual selection, integrate into a convergent set of
#' factors that produce sexual variation. Ecologically-modulated, sexually mediated variation within and between
#' sexes may be a major contributor to the amount of total variation that selection can act on in species. Threespine
#' stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) display rapid adaptive responses and sexual variation in many phenotypic
#' traits. We examined phenotypic variation in the skull, pectoral and pelvic girdles of threespine stickleback from
#' two freshwater and two coastal marine sites on the Sunshine Coast of British Columbia, Canada, using an approach
#' that avoids a priori assumptions about bimodal patterns of variation. We quantified shape and size of the cranial,
#' pectoral and pelvic regions of sticklebacks in marine and freshwater habitats using 3D geometric morphometrics and
#' an index of sexually mediated variation. We show that the expression of phenotypic variation is structured in part
#' by the effects of both habitat marine vs freshwater and the effects of individual sites within each habitat.
#' Relative size exerts variable influence, and patterns of phenotypic variation associated with sex vary among body
#' regions. This fine-grained quantification of sexually mediated variation in the context of habitat difference and
#' different anatomical structures indicates a complex relationship between genetically inferred sex and environmental
#' factors, demonstrating that the interplay between shared genetic background and sexually mediated, ecologically-
#' based selective pressures structures the phenotypic expression of complex traits.
